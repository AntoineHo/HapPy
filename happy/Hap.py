"""
Estimate assembly haploidy based on base depth of coverage histogram.

usage:
    HapPy [-hv] <command> [<args>...]

options:
    -h, --help                  shows the help
    -v, --version               shows the version

The subcommands are:
    coverage   Compute coverage histogram.
    estimate   Finds peaks and computes haploidy scores.
    autoest    Builds a model to fit peaks and computes haploidy scores.
